Working on a better and more detailed system that better captures the mechanics of the smoke.
Will update a link to the reop when i get it up and running.

Features:
- Generating volume of smoke with small units.
- Smoke units spawn around objects.
- Smoke disappears if object enters volume, then regenerates(wip).

To add:
- Smoke does not wrap around objects that are farther than a threshold from the center.
- Smoke forms non-spherical shapes.
